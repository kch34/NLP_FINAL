# Web Scraping for News Articles

In this directory, there are five `.ipynb` files for web-scraping **political** news articles from [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/politics), [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics), [AXIOS](https://www.axios.com/politics-policy), [Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/politics/), and [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics) respectively. 

**Please execute the code in local Jupyter Notebook** as the code will invoke Google Chrome webdriver, which is not easy to run on cloud-based services like Google Colab.
